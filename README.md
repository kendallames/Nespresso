# Nespresso

Using mySQL, I created a Nespresso database containing three tables. The first table titled 'Capsules' contains all of the available capsules on Nespresso.com as of 5/29/2023 and various columns such as intensity, origin and price. The second table, titled 'Coffee Profile' contains information on the bitterness, acidity, body and roast of each capsule. The final table titled 'Kendall_Ratings' contain my personal rating out of 5 for each capsule and whether or not I would repurchase. All three of these tables are available as CSV files within this Nespresso repository.
