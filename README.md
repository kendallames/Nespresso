# Nespresso

Using mySQL, I created a Nespresso database containing three tables. The first table titled 'Capsules' contains all of the available capsules on Nespresso.com as of 5/29/2023 and various columns such as intensity, origin and price. The second table, titled 'Coffee_Profile' contains information on the bitterness, acidity, body and roast of each capsule. The final table titled 'Kendall_Ratings' contain my personal rating out of 5 for each capsule and whether or not I would repurchase. All three of these tables are available as CSV files within this Nespresso repository. Cheers! ☕️

## CSV Files
- Capsules.csv
- Coffee_Profile.csv
- Kendall_Ratings.csv

## Project Goals
- Query the tables using mySQL to better understand the data acquired 
- Clean, perform EDA, model and visualize the data
- Build a model using Python that predicts the likeliness I will like a new coffee that gets released based on the new coffee's various characteristics in comparison to my current Nespresso preferences
- Build confidence in SQL and Python skills
